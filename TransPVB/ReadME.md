## Point-Voxel RCNN 
- Integration of Voxel information to Keypoint, and Keypoint information to Grid for RoI Pooling in the 3D Object Detection with point clouds

## Newly Proposed `TransPVB`

## What the model consits of (base on the paper)
- Most of the object detection tasks goes through 2 stages 
    1. 
#### 1. VFE: Voxel Feature Encoder
